        <h1>Biography : Amaan Ahammed V</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Amaan Ahammed V, a 19-year-old tech enthusiast and professional volleyball player from Kozhikode, Kerala — currently pursuing my B.Tech at Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science, Kochi.

A proud alumnus of the Kerala State Syllabus (+2), my journey blends academics, sports, and a deep curiosity for technology. As a student, I strive to constantly expand my knowledge of how technology shapes the world. Outside the classroom, I’ve represented my university in major volleyball tournaments, including the prestigious KTU university league.

Fluent in Malayalam and English, I bring with me the values and determination rooted in Kerala’s vibrant culture. My hobbies revolve around exploring the latest in technology — from gadgets to innovations — always eager to understand how things work and how they can be improved.

In the next 5 to 10 years, I aim to first gain industry experience by working with leading companies and eventually channel my knowledge and vision into building a company of my own. I believe in dreaming big and working smart to make an impact.
